Task Management System (React + Laravel)
Problem Description

Create a Task Management Application that allows users to:
• Create, view, update, and delete tasks.
• Use Laravel as the backend (API server).
• Use React as the frontend (UI client) that communicates via HTTP requests.
You must use Git to manage your progress — each task represents a commit milestone (or Git branch)
to demonstrate your work history.
